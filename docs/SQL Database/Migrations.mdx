:::tip
For the migration management is responsible [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) framework. You can find more detailed information and command at the official documentation.

## Shallow migration

During the development you probably want to change the database schema and try the changes without creation of the migration file. With prisma you can do it with:

```shell
npx prisma db push
```

And then decide wherer your changes are worth it or not and create a migration file or revert the database state.

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma migrate reset
```

## Create migration file

### From current schema

Edit `./prisma/schema.prisma` schema.

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### From custom SQL

```shell
Create an empty migration file:
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

Edit the created migration file `./prisma/migrations/??/??.sql` and apply it:

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev
```
