# Environment

## Backend

A basic backend infrastructure is set according to the following principles.
All of these parts are started by the `docker-compose` command.

### Github Store

The `Projects` microservice is responsible for storing the projects in Github repositories.
Thats the reason of required `Github` organization account and github access token.

### Microservice interface

Each microservice has standardised interface:

- `GET /about` - endpoint for getting information about microservice
- `GET /about/health` - endpoint for getting health status of microservice (online/offline)
- `RabbitMQ` - RabbitMQ queue for communication between microservices
  - `Logs` - create and send a log message
  - `Emails` - create email message and send it
  - `Notifications` - create notification message for a specific user

Of course, there is a possibility to add additional interfaces.

## Frontend
Web client is implemnted as a Next.js application that uses microservices via Gateway, see Backend architecture, and may load additional interpreters from the internet via provided URL from the server.

The loaded interpreteris a `ES6` module that is loaded via dynamic `import` statement.
