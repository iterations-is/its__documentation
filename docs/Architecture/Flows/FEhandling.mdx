# Client Request Lifecycle

The main lifecycle of authorization cycle and how `axios` with `useAuthorization()` hook works.

<Mermaid
	chart={`
		sequenceDiagram
			actor User
			User->>React: authorized request (R1)
			activate React
			React ->> React: get access token from storage
      React ->> React: prepare R1
      React->>Gateway: R1
			activate Gateway
			alt access token is valid
				Gateway-->>React: 20x response
			  deactivate Gateway
				React -->> User: show R1
      else expired access token
			  React ->> React: get refresh token from storage
        React ->> Gateway: refresh pair (R2)
			  activate Gateway
        alt refresh token token is valid
          Gateway -->> React: 201 new token pair
          React ->> Gateway: repeat R1
          Note right of Gateway: see flow above
        else expired refresh token
          Gateway -->> React: 403 unauthorized
          deactivate Gateway
          React ->> React: sign out
				  React -->> User: show sign in screen
        end
			  deactivate React
			end
`}
/>

## Hooks

### `useAxios()`

Provides 2 clients for authorized and unauthorized requests.
Should be used with `react-query` library to handle network requests, e.g.:

```jsx
import { useAxios } from '../hooks';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

const Component = () => {
	const { axiosAuth } = useAxios();
	const rqSomething = useQuery('something', () => axiosAuth.get('/something'));

	return <>{JSON.stringify(rqSomething.data, null, 3)}</>;
};
```

### `useAuthorization()`

The hook should be used only at nextjs pages.
According to set paramenter it redirects use to appropriate pages if needed.
An unauthorized user is redirected to sign in page and after successful login will be redirected back (see callback in URL).
