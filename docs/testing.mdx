# Testing

## Unit tests

Each MS repository has unit tests automatically run when you do `git push`.
They also may run via:

```
yarn test
```

Or

```
yarn test:coverage
```

## Integration API tests

In a stand-alone repository `its-testing` is located a jest environment with integration tests against the API.

Before running the tests, you need to deploy the server path of the system and configure the `.env.text` file according `.env.test.example`.

The tests are run via:

```
yarn test
```
