# Production

:::info
Production instance. How to set up and start the environment.
:::

## Requirements

- `its` [repository](https://github.com/iterations-is/its) and access to all microservice repositories (submodules)
- docker
- shell
- Github account, organization and a token with access to create/update organization repositories (projects are stored at Github)

## Source code

Clone main repository with all submodules:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:iterations-is/its.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Configuration

Create `.env.production` files from production examples (`.env.production.example` in each microservice repository) manually or via:

```
sh env-create.prod.sh
```

Add required information to some `.env.production` files - see output of `env-create.prod.sh`.

Special variables:
- `API_INTERNAL_TOKEN` takes care about security of internal API access, should be the same across all microservices.

## Running

Start databases, message broker, microservices and gateway with docker-compose:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
# or
yarn s:prod
```

Some containers may fall after first run because of time-consuming initialization (`dependent_on` property doesn't work). Just restart them later in this order:

- databases and broker
- microservices
- gateway

```shell
yarn t:prod restart <name>
```

:::danger FIXME time-dependent services
Some services need to wait for other services to be ready. Write wait-for-it scripts, see [Docker - Startup Order](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/).
:::

You can stop everything with:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
# or
yarn d:prod
```

An alias for production environment is `yarn t:prod`, all production related docker-compose command may be called as:

```shell
yarn t:prod restart [service]
yarn t:prod up [service]
# etc
```

## Available access points

- [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) - frontend
- [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000) - backend API gateway
