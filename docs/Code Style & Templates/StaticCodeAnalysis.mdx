# Static Code Analysis

Each microservice has integrated:

- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

You can run:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

To check the current code style.

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

May also automatically fix the code style according to configuration.
